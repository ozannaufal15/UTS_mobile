        <item>A novel about a mother\'s unbreakable love in a world consumed by fear.
            Twelve-year-old Bird Gardner lives a quiet existence with his loving but broken father,
            a former linguist who now shelves books in a university library. Bird knows to not ask too many questions,
            stand out too much, or stray too far. For a decade, their lives have been governed by laws written to
            preserve “American culture” in the wake of years of economic instability and violence. To keep the peace and restore
            prosperity, the authorities are now allowed to relocate children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin, and
            libraries have been forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic—including the work of Bird\'s mother, Margaret,
            a Chinese American poet who left the family when he was nine years old. Bird has grown up disavowing his mother and her poems;
            he doesn\'t know her work or what happened to her, and he knows he shouldn\'t wonder. But when he receives a mysterious letter
            containing only a cryptic drawing, he is pulled into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many folktales
            she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground network of librarians, into the lives of the children who
            have been taken, and finally to New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of much-needed change.</item>

        <item>A soul-stirring novel about what we choose to keep from our past, and what we choose to leave behind.
            Olivia McAfee knows what it feels like to start over. Her picture-perfect life—living in Boston, married to a brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon, raising a beautiful son,
            Asher—was upended when her husband revealed a darker side. She never imagined she would end up back in her sleepy New Hampshire hometown, living in the house she grew up in, and taking over her father\'s beekeeping business.
            Lily Campanello is familiar with do-overs, too. When she and her mom relocate to Adams, New Hampshire, for her final year of high school, they both hope it will be a fresh start.
            And for just a short while, these new beginnings are exactly what Olivia and Lily need. Their paths cross when Asher falls for the new girl in school, and Lily can\'t help but fall for him, too. With Ash, she feels happy for the first time. Yet at times, she wonders if she can she trust him completely . . .
            Then one day, Olivia receives a phone call: Lily is dead, and Asher is being questioned by the police. Olivia is adamant that her son is innocent. But she would be lying if she didn\'t acknowledge the flashes of his father\'s temper in him, and as the case against him unfolds, she realizes he\'s hidden more than he\'s shared with her.
            Mad Honey is a riveting novel of suspense, an unforgettable love story, and a moving and powerful exploration of the secrets we keep and the risks we take in order to become ourselves.</item>

        <item>In this riveting and immersive novel, bestselling author Thrity Umrigar tells the story of two couples and the sometimes dangerous
            and heartbreaking challenges of love across a cultural divide.
            Indian American journalist Smita has returned to India to cover a story, but reluctantly: long ago she and her family left
            the country with no intention of ever coming back. As she follows the case of Meena—a Hindu woman attacked by members of her
            own village and her own family for marrying a Muslim man—Smita comes face to face with a society where tradition carries more
            weight than one\'s own heart, and a story that threatens to unearth the painful secrets of Smita\'s own past. While Meena\'s fate
            hangs in the balance, Smita tries in every way she can to right the scales. She also finds herself increasingly drawn to Mohan,
            an Indian man she meets while on assignment. But the dual love stories of Honor are as different as the cultures of Meena and
            Smita themselves: Smita realizes she has the freedom to enter into a casual affair, knowing she can decide later how much it
            means to her.
            In this tender and evocative novel about love, hope, familial devotion, betrayal, and sacrifice, Thrity Umrigar shows us two
            courageous women trying to navigate how to be true to their homelands and themselves at the same time.</item>

            With her celebrated humor, insight, and heart, beloved New York Times
            bestseller Emma Straub offers her own twist on traditional time travel tropes, and a different kind of love story.
            On the eve of her 40th birthday, Alice\'s life isn\'t terrible. She likes her job, even if it isn\'t exactly the one

        <item>In the tradition of Long Bright River and The Mars Room, a gripping and atmospheric work of literary suspense that deconstructs the story of a serial killer on death row, told primarily through the eyes of the women in his life—from the bestselling author of Girl in Snow.
            Ansel Packer is scheduled to die in twelve hours. He knows what he\'s done, and now awaits execution, the same chilling fate he forced on those girls, years ago. But Ansel doesn\'t want to die; he wants to be celebrated, understood. He hoped it wouldn\'t end like this, not for him.
            Through a kaleidoscope of women—a mother, a sister, a homicide detective—we learn the story of Ansel\'s life. We meet his mother, Lavender, a seventeen-year-old girl pushed to desperation; Hazel, twin sister to Ansel\'s wife, inseparable since birth, forced to watch helplessly as her sister\'s relationship threatens to devour them all; and finally, Saffy, the homicide detective hot on his trail, who has devoted herself to bringing bad men to justice but struggles to see her own life clearly. As the clock ticks down, these three women sift through the choices that culminate in tragedy, exploring the rippling fissures that such destruction inevitably leaves in its wake.
            Blending breathtaking suspense with astonishing empathy, Notes on an Execution presents a chilling portrait of womanhood as it simultaneously unravels the familiar narrative of the American serial killer, interrogating our system of justice and our cultural obsession with crime stories, asking readers to consider the false promise of looking for meaning in the psyches of violent men.</item>

In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist, but she\'s always been haunted by the fear that it could\'ve been her. And the worst part is, January\'s killer has never been brought to justice.

            It\'s watching.
            Liz Rocher is coming home . . . reluctantly. As a Black woman, Liz doesn\'t exactly have fond memories of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a predominantly white town. But her best friend is getting married, so she braces herself for a weekend of awkward and passive-aggressive reunions. Liz has grown, though; she can handle whatever awaits her. But on the day of the wedding, somewhere between dancing and dessert, the bride\'s daughter, Caroline, goes missing—and the only thing left behind is a piece of white fabric covered in blood.
            It\'s taking.
            As a frantic search begins, with the police combing the trees for Caroline, Liz is the only one who notices a pattern: a summer night. A missing girl. A party in the woods. She\'s seen this before. Keisha Woodson, the only other Black girl in school, walked into the woods with a mysterious man and was later found with her chest cavity ripped open and her heart missing. Liz shudders at the thought that it could have been her, and now, with Caroline missing, it can't be a coincidence. As Liz starts to dig through the town's history, she uncovers a horrifying secret about the place she once called home. Children have been going missing in these woods for years. All of them Black. All of them girls.
            It\'s your turn.
            With the evil in the forest creeping closer, Liz knows what she must do: find Caroline, or be entirely consumed by the darkness.</item>
